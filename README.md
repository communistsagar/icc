OpenCric
========
OpenCric is an open source php script that allows you to create a full featured live cricket score website without any effort. 
Please keep in mind that OpenCric only features live cricket score and ball by ball updates. 
Fixtures, Results are not available right now, due to ESPN's API limitation. However, I'll try to add 'em in upcoming version(s).  

##Please note: 

* OpenCric is powered by ESPNCricinfo API and it may have few limitations or copyright issues
* OpenCric is released under The MIT License ( https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT ) 
* Former version of OpenCric is deprecated and will not be updated any more.
